# Download for macOS

The recommended installation method is via [Homebrew Cask](https://brew.sh/):
```
$ brew cask install vorta
```

Even though Vorta comes with Borg built-in, using an official Borg installation is recommended:
```
$ brew install borgbackup
```

## Binary Install
If you don't use Homebrew, you can find [releases](https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/releases) on our Github page.
