# Install on macOS

The recommended installation method is via [Homebrew Cask](https://brew.sh/):
```
$ brew cask install vorta
```

This will install Vorta and BorgBackup for you. If you also need the mount feature, install FUSE as well:
```
$ brew cask install osxfuse
```

## Binary Install
If you don't use Homebrew, you can find [releases](https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/releases) on our Github page.
