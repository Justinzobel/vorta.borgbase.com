# Using Vorta

### Introduction
Vorta is a cross-platform open source backup client. It makes managing Borg backups easy and there is no need to run commands in the Terminal.

Vorta is also open source and everyone can contribute to improve the app or look at the source code. Together with Borg, which is also open source, this creates a strong chain of trust. By using Vorta, you can benefit from Borg's strengths and have the convenience of a graphical user interface at the same time.

If you are new to Vorta and Borg Backup, be sure to start with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asZX2YbTaNE) by Sun Knudsen. He gives a high level overview Borg's concepts and then walks through doing backups with Vorta step-by-step.
