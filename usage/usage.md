# Using Vorta

**Note**: Vorta is currently in beta-testing and shouldn't be your only backup solution.

### Introduction
Vorta is a cross-platform open source backup client. It makes managing Borg backups easy and there is no need to run commands in the Terminal.

Vorta is also open source and everyone can contribute to improve the app or look at the source code. Together with Borg, which is also open source, this creates a strong chain of trust. By using Vorta, the user can benefit from all the strong point of Borg and have the convenience of a graphical user interface at the same time.
